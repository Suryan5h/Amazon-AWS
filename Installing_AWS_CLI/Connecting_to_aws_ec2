Command : aws configure
1. Enter access key id
2. Enter Secret access key
3. Default region name (ap-south-1)
4. Enter Default Output format - Which can be JSON, Text, Table; (we use json)

Command to check if we have access to s3
:   aws s3 ls

command : cat ~/.aws/credentials

Now if we run aws configure again, these values will come preloaded.
Now we can access aws services directly from the CLI.

***********
Windows users need to type the following command in the command prompt to access the ‘credentials’ file:

notepad "./.aws/credentials" 

If you are a Windows user, then you must provide the application name (notepad) and the path of the file (“./.aws/credentials”)
to open a file through the command prompt.
